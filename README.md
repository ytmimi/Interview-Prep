## Interview Prep Questions

A collections of interview questions with answers in Python

Please adhere to the follwing guidlines when adding new questions and answers to the repo:

*1)* Add questions and answers to the appropriate section. If you would like to add questions that belong to a section that doesn't already exist, feel free to add a new directory with the section title that includes a questions.ipynb and answers.ipynb in it.

*2)* When adding questions, please include the full question and any notes provided in the original source in a markdown cell. Also insure that you each question is numberd. When adding answers to the answers.ipynb a markdown cell referencing the question number should preceed all code cells.
